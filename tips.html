				<h1>Having a great potluck</h1>
				<p>Never thrown a potluck party before? Here are some tips to help it happen without a hitch.</p>
				<h2>Get an idea of who’s coming, and let everyone know what your estimates are</h2>
				<p>This is more of a problem with smaller potlucks, but it’s something worth mentioning. If all your guests plan on cooking for eight people but twelve show up (this happens when people bring surprise friends), people are gonna go hungry. If you, or your guests, have a chance of bringing extra people, communicate that with everyone so people know to err on the side of bringing more than less. This is doubly important for people who’re bringing things that doesn’t have substitutions, like plates and cups.</p>
				<h2>Try to have a bunch of food types</h2>
				<p>While it’s important to make sure that everyone knows what sorts of dietary restrictions people will have (if all the entrées are cheesy casseroles, the lactose intolerant won’t have anything to eat), it’s also nice to balance the foods based on other aspects as well:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>light vs. heavy</li>
				<li>acidic vs. oily</li>
				<li>hot vs. cold vs. room-temperature</li>
				</ul>
				<p>This also goes for drinks as well. Not everyone likes Coke. Also, if people are drinking alcoholic drinks, you want people to be able to switch to soda at least partway through. If someone’s bringing White Claw or another alcoholic fruity seltzer water, it’s a good idea to have non-alcoholic fruity seltzer water like La Croix on hand as well.</p>
